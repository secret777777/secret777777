Interpreting user needs and implementing them into a program starts with understanding the requirements from the user's perspective. 
This involves actively listening to stakeholders and users to gather insights into what they need the program to accomplish. 
Creating "user stories" is a practical way to document these needs in Agile development. User stories are short,
simple descriptions that capture what a user wants to achieve with a feature,
which helps in clarifying priorities and ensuring the development stays focused on delivering value.

When approaching program development, 
I aim to incorporate Agile processes that facilitate iterative improvement and responsiveness to change. Specifically, I'm interested in adopting Scrum for its structured approach to managing work in sprints, conducting regular reviews and retrospectives, and maintaining a prioritized backlog of user stories. I also see the value in elements of Kanban for visualizing workflow and ensuring continuous delivery, which can enhance efficiency and adaptability in development cycles.

Being a good team member in software development involves effective communication, both within the team and with stakeholders,
to ensure everyone is aligned on goals and progress. 
Collaboration is key, as it encourages sharing ideas and knowledge,
and supports the team in overcoming challenges together. Being adaptable to change and committed to delivering quality work on time are also crucial traits. Ultimately, contributing positively to team dynamics and respecting diverse perspectives fosters a productive and supportive work environment.

These principles guide me as I continue to learn and grow in software development, aiming to deliver solutions that meet user needs effectively and contribute to the success of the team.
